# When you launch your Firefox browser, it loads your save preferences.
# On Windows these are often found in %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\.

# By default Firefox will prompt you when downloading a file.
# After changing this setting, your handlers.json file will be modified.

# Initially nothing is in the profile directory.
# When you launch the driver, user.js is created.

# What are the minimum requirements for a profile?
# You can create a directory containing user.js and it works.

# You can pass a file path to an empty directory, and it works.
# A tempory directory will be created with a new user.js with the defaults.

# If we just update handlers, is that enough?

## Input parameters:
# NOTE: Firefox executable needs to be in the same directory as geckodriver, 
# or set as en environmental variable. (Is it set on Windows side?)

addr_data = '/home/twesleyb/projects/open-realestate/data/durham.csv'

## Create firefox profile.
# NOTE: (1) Calls to FirefoxProfile() create a temporary firefox profile, 
# which is saved in /tmp/. e.g.: /tmpt/tmpizzfipxs
# You can see its path with: profile.path
# NOTE: (2) You can pass a path to FirefoxProfile().
# If you do this, a temporary copy of the profile is made. Its path looks
# like:
# > profile.path
# '/tmp/tmpvo_h1gzw/webdriver-py-profilecopy'
# The driver will inherit any settings set in this directory.
profile = FirefoxProfile(firefox_profile)

launch_gecko(gecko_path,firefox_profile=profile,url=gomaps,headless=True)

## Create webdriver.
driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=gecko_driver,
    options=options,firefox_profile=profile,
    service_log_path = '/dev/null') # Supress output logs.

## Navigate to durham gomaps
gomaps = 'http://maps2.roktech.net/durhamnc_gomaps4/'
driver.get(gomaps)

## Load address list.
addr_list = load_durham_addresses(addr_data)

## Get an address.
i = randrange(len(addr_list))
address = addr_list[i]

# Search for address.
response = find_address(driver,address)

# Check response.
print(response)

# Increase buffer distance.
#add_buffer(driver,buffer_dist=1000)

# Download results.
